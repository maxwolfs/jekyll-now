title: Lox / Solenoid Magic

With the code being able to set a date, show the remaining time and calling the final function which executes the unlocking
mechanism it's finally time to decide on the mechanism itself. Fortunately I already have a tested Solenoid Driver Circuit from
the Sound course I'm taking.

My Professor Dennis P. Paul suggested a serve motor that is driving a gear wheel that's connected to four axis which are
pulling in and thus release the lock. It's super nice and smart to use only one motor instead of four or two solenoids
but there are two things which I am not convinced of by this solution.

1. It takes too much space in the inside of the lid. Especially the positioning of the main gear wheel isn't possible with the layout of display and the top button.
2. The sound a servo motor is producing is awful. It's high pitch sound induces the feeling of a cheap RC car. Imagine you lock something away for 20 years and then you'll hear this. No! It must definitely have another sound. The Solenoids are cool because their sound of knocking against the wall of the container hiding the things is a nice metaphor somehow.

But with the decision of Solenoids there is the question which ones to take that match my specs of power and are even able to activate the push-push-actuators to open the lid.
Solenoids are hard to get and aren't that cheap. So I basically bought almost every solenoid on Ebay and Amazon to try them.
