title: Lox / How to Open?
---

A big question is coming up again and again. How will the opening mechanism actually work?
There were a few suggestions that it could be opened with a top handle or carved out holes.
But I want to stick with the clean & flat design.

After a thinking it over and over I was holding my pen and clicking it while thinking about.
There it was! The pen mechanism: A push-push element as known in drawers.
You push them to open and push again to close it and it will stay in its position.

I have ordered the cheapest ones from IKEA, but unfortunately they were too big,
the spring needs to much force and range of spring with 80mm was too long.

After thinking for quite a while I thought that it could exploit the mechanism out of pens.
I did a few trips to office stores but I there weren't suitable ones.

Then I finally found a rotary push encoder from a test package that came with the
EC11 encoders. Perfect! Enough force, decent spring range and small form factor.
